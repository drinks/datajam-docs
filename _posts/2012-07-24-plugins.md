    Chat adds a real-time chat system to your datajam events.

    Guests can choose a nickname without registration, and their messages
    will be displayed in the stream as they are approved through a moderation
    interface in the heads-up toolbar.

    **Add to your Pluginfile:**

        gem 'datajam-chat', :require => 'datajam/chat'

- #### Datacard
    ![Datacard](/img/datacard_poster.png)
    Datacard is a visualization engine for displaying statistics, charts and graphs.

    Cards can be created from raw HTML, CSV, or by querying datasets from remote
    APIs, made available through simple installable mappings.

    **Add to your Pluginfile:**

        gem 'datajam-datacard', :require => 'datajam/datacard'
