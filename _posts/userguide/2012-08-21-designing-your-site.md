## Introduction

So, you've got your site up and running, but it's pretty sparse, and pretty
generic. It's easy to customize the look and feel of your Datajam site using
the powerful built-in template system.

### Anatomy of a Datajam Site

A site running on Datajam has a few types of pages:

- Home Page
- Event Pages
- Static Pages
- Archives

#### Homepage

By default, the homepage shows the first upcoming event in your event list.
When an event is over, it can be archived, so that the next event will display.
You can populate the event with a 'Coming Soon' message, and let users sign up
to get an email reminder before the event starts.

#### Event Pages

Even though your users will interact most with the homepage, each event has
a permalink as well.
