### Installation

You can install it by adding

    gem 'datajam-chat', git: 'https://github.com/sunlightlabs/datajam-chat.git', require: 'datajam/chat'

to your Pluginfile. Once you've done that, run `bundle` locally, and deploy your
site to Heroku. When your site comes back up, visit the admin/plugins page on your
site, and you should see "Datajam Chat" in the list.

![plugin list](/img/userguide/plugins-chat.png)

Click the item in the list, and select "install" from the "actions" menu.

Once chat is installed, add a chat_area to your event template.

Save your template, and visit your homepage again.

### Managing Chats

You should see 'Live Chat'
in your onair toolbar now, but no chat thread on the screen. That's because
the chat is currently closed. To open it, click "Live Chat" in the toolbar.

#### Opening

Set the select box to "open" to enable the chat.

![opening chat](/img/userguide/opening-chat.png)

You should now see a chat thread on your page. You'll be logged in automatically,
since you are a registered user.

#### Identification

Anonymous users will be prompted to enter a name. They can choose any
name that hasn't already been chosen by someone else, or belongs to any
of the registered users. Likewise, while logged in, you can only post as
the name that you're registered with in the admin.

After the event, it's important to clear the chat "sessions" from the
admin page, so that each user will find their name available the next time
they are on your site and want to participate in a chat.



Admin users are able to post without approval, but messages from all anonymous
users are moderated. When a message is waiting, a badge will appear next to the
chat menu item in the toolbar.

![incoming message](/img/userguide/incoming-message.png)

To approve it, click the menu item. You'll see the text of the message in
the "incoming" pane of the chat dialog. As you hover over the left or right
of the message, you'll see an overlay with an arrow pointing in the direction
that you hover. To the right is the approved stream, to the left the rejected
stream. Click on the right side overlay, to move the message into the approved
stream.

![approving a message](/img/userguide/approving-a-message.png)

You can also edit or delete messages that have been published to the stream
already, in case you make a typing error, or two admins post the same
thing simultaneously during the event. You cannot edit messages that are incoming,
as users' messages should be approved or rejected, not altered.

To edit a message, click the message's pencil icon in the chat dialog.

![editing comments](/img/userguide/editing-comments.png)

You'll see the text of the comment turn into an input area, into which you can
change or enter the new text. Your changes will be saved as soon as you deselect
the text area.

To delete a message, click the 'x' icon right next to the pencil.

**After the event is over**

You can archive your chats once the event is over to stop allowing new messages.
